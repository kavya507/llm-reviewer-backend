# LLM Reviewer Backend

**LLM Reviewer** is a FastAPI backend that leverages advanced language models (LLMs) to automatically summarize customer reviews. It is designed to work seamlessly with the [llm-reviewer-frontend](https://github.com/yourusername/llm-reviewer-frontend) browser extension, which scrapes reviews from Amazon product pages and sends them to this API for instant, AI-powered insights.

---

## üöÄ What Does This Project Do?

This backend receives a list of product reviews (in any language), processes them through a chain of LLM-powered steps, and returns a concise summary of the top pros and cons. This helps users quickly understand the strengths and weaknesses of a product without reading hundreds or thousands of individual reviews.

## üß† Real-World AI in Action

AI is transforming how we interact with information. In this project, AI is used to:
- **Aggregate and analyze large volumes of user-generated content** (reviews)
- **Extract key insights** (pros and cons) that matter most to potential buyers
- **Enable multilingual understanding** by processing reviews in any language
- **Deliver instant, actionable summaries** for better, faster decision-making

This is a practical example of how LLMs can be used to automate research, enhance e-commerce experiences, and save users valuable time.

## üåê How It Works: End-to-End Flow

1. **User browses an Amazon product page**
2. **llm-reviewer-frontend browser extension** scrapes all visible reviews
3. The extension sends the reviews to this backend's `/summarize` API endpoint
4. The backend uses a LangChain-powered LLM chain to analyze and summarize the reviews
5. The extension displays the summary (pros and cons) directly in the browser
