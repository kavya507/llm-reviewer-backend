# LLM Reviewer Backend

**LLM Reviewer** is a FastAPI backend that leverages advanced language models (LLMs) to automatically summarize customer reviews. Designed to work seamlessly with the [llm-reviewer-frontend](https://github.com/yourusername/llm-reviewer-frontend) browser extension, it enables users to scrape reviews from the product pages and instantly receive AI-powered summaries of the top pros and cons. By processing reviews in any language through a chain of LLM-powered steps, this backend helps users quickly understand a product‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses without reading hundreds of individual reviews.

## üß† Real-World AI in Action

AI is transforming how we interact with information. In this project, AI is used to:
- **Aggregate and analyze large volumes of user-generated content** (reviews)
- **Extract key insights** (pros and cons) that matter most to potential buyers
- **Deliver instant, actionable summaries** for better, faster decision-making

This is a practical example of how LLMs can be used to automate research, enhance e-commerce experiences, and save users valuable time.

## üåê How It Works: End-to-End Flow

1. **User browses an Amazon product page**
2. **llm-reviewer-frontend browser extension** scrapes all visible reviews
3. The extension sends the reviews to this backend's `/summarize` API endpoint
4. The backend uses a LangChain-powered LLM chain to analyze and summarize the reviews
5. The extension displays the summary (pros and cons) directly in the browser
